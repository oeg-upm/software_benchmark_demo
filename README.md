# software_benchmark_demo
This demo extract software mentions from a text. It uses fine-tuned models from SCIBERT using different corpora.
* SoMESCi [1]: We have used the corpus uploaded to [Github](https://github.com/dave-s477/SoMeSci/tree/9f17a43f342be026f97f03749457d4abb1b01dbf/PLoS_sentences), more specifically, the corpus created with sentences.
* Softcite [2]: This project has published another corpus for software mentions, which is also available on [Github](https://github.com/howisonlab/softcite-dataset/tree/master/data/corpus). We have to note that we only use the annotations from bio domain.
* [Benchmark Bio](https://huggingface.co/oeg/software_benchmark_bio): Corpus created by reconciling the somesci and softcite corpora. Only BIO domain
* [Benchmark Multidomain](https://huggingface.co/oeg/software_benchmark_multidomain): Corpus created by reconciling the somesci and softcite corpora (including economics domain) and papers with code [corpus](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10033751).
